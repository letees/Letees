This repository is made by a 15 year-old boy. I will introduce useful things for Mac, Windows and Raspberry Pi.

This repository is divides in three sections : Mac OS X, Windows and Raspberry, the OS I work with. Because of this structure (subcarpets), you can't download a especific archive from Terminal. I recommend you to enter to Github.com, logging in, Star this repository (jejeje), and download the file you want. 

THANK YOU!
